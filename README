This script I use for marking changes in text files with the html ins and del tags.

To mark something something to insert past the current char press <F5> in normal mode.  "<ins></ins>" appears. The caret is where you would expect it in insert mode.

To mark something to be deleted mark it in visual mode and press
D.  "<del>...</del>" appears around it.

For convenience R (replace) in visual mode is bound to D<F5>.
